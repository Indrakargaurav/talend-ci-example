 🔄 SyncStream – GitHub-Triggered CDC Pipeline

SyncStream is a **Change Data Capture (CDC) pipeline** that leverages **Talend**, **Jenkins**, and **GitHub webhooks** to provide an **event-driven, automated ETL workflow**.
The pipeline ensures that every code commit or data update triggers incremental processing with **traceability** and **minimal manual intervention**.

---

## ✨ Features
- ⚡ **Event-Driven ETL** → Automatically triggered via **GitHub webhooks**  
- 🔗 **Orchestrated with Jenkins** → Robust CI/CD integration  
- 🛠️ **Talend for ETL** → Designed ETL jobs to extract, transform, and load efficiently  
- 📈 **Change Data Capture** → Processes only incremental changes (CDC) instead of full data loads  
- 📂 **Traceability** → Logs and versioning ensure transparency and reproducibility  
- 🔄 **Automated Workflow** → End-to-end automation, reducing operational overhead

    A[GitHub Webhook] --> B[Jenkins Pipeline]
    B --> C[Talend CDC Job]
    C --> D[Target Database]
    D --> E[Processed & Incremental Data]

Webhook → A commit or event in GitHub triggers the webhook

Jenkins → Executes the automation pipeline

Talend CDC Job → Runs ETL logic for incremental changes

Database → Loads transformed data with versioning & traceability

🛠️ Tech Stack
ETL → Talend

CI/CD → Jenkins

Automation → GitHub Webhooks

Databases → (Configurable: MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)

Languages → Java, Bash, SQL

🚀 Setup & Usage
1️⃣ Prerequisites
🐳 Docker (optional for containerized Talend jobs)

⚙️ Jenkins installed & configured

🧩 Talend jobs exported as .jar files

📂 Database instance ready (MySQL/Postgres/other)

2️⃣ Configuration
Clone this repo:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/SyncStream.git
cd SyncStream
Configure Jenkins pipeline to trigger Talend jobs on webhook events

Update database credentials in config files

Set up GitHub webhook (Settings → Webhooks → Add)

3️⃣ Run
Push a commit to GitHub → Jenkins pipeline runs → Talend CDC job executes → Updated data is loaded

📊 Example Workflow
Developer commits changes to ETL logic/data schema

GitHub webhook notifies Jenkins

Jenkins triggers the Talend CDC job

Only the incremental changes are extracted & processed

Data is loaded into the target database with logs for auditing

📌 Use Cases
🔄 Keeping data warehouses synced with source systems

📉 Optimized ETL with incremental updates only

🧪 CI/CD integration for data engineering pipelines

🏢 Enterprise-ready workflow for scalable CDC pipelines

🌱 Future Enhancements
📡 Add monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana

☁️ Deploy on AWS (Lambda, S3, RDS) for cloud-native operation

🗂️ Extend to support streaming CDC with Kafka

🔒 Integrate security & access controls for enterprise-grade usage
